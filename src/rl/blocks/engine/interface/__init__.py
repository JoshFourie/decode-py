'''
The .engine submodule is responsible for exposing an interface to algorithms in reinforcement learning. 
Those algorithms can be implemented in nested modules under .engine or imported and wrapped around the interface. The 
.engine submodule makes those algorithms weavable with items from the .widgets module.
