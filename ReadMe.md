# Zalia Flow: `Decoded`

A library for composable explainability in reinforcement learning agents.

## What's that?

Reading explanations of other people's RL agents and giving explanations of our own sucks. We want to
write and train our RL agents and then deploy that into a front-end for others to explore.

No more crawling through Python code and more focus on seeing algorithms in action.

## Who are we?
Zalia Flow ([zaliaflow.io](https://zaliaflow.io)) is an enterprise toolkit for building artificial intelligence that people delight in trusting. 
Our core libraries are released as open-source software.

# Getting started
We're undergoing a rebuild right now. We'll upload an example as soon as possible.

## How can you help?
Help us find out what's the single most impactful view of your machine-learning code that would make it effortless to explain.
